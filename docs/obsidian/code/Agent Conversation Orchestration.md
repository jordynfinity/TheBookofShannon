# Agent Conversation Orchestration

The Agent Conversation Orchestration component manages the interactions between multiple agents, facilitating rich, dynamic conversations based on prompts detected by the Folder Watching Interface.

## Intention & Direction

The Agent Conversation Orchestration is designed to create a sophisticated, multi-agent conversation ecosystem. Its architecture aims to:

1. **Enable Complex Conversation Topologies** - Moving beyond simple turn-taking, the system supports branching, merging, and parallel conversation threads that better reflect natural human discourse.

2. **Support Emergent Dialogue Patterns** - Rather than enforcing rigid conversation structures, the system allows for emergent patterns that arise from agent interactions, creating more natural and insightful exchanges.

3. **Create Context-Aware Conversations** - By maintaining rich conversation contexts that include not just the immediate history but also related knowledge and previous interactions, the system enables more coherent and meaningful dialogues.

4. **Facilitate Meta-Conversations** - The system supports conversations about conversations, allowing agents to reflect on and improve their dialogue patterns over time.

## Core Components

### Agent Selection Engine

The Agent Selection Engine determines which agents should participate in a conversation. It:

- Analyzes prompt content and requirements
- Matches prompt needs with agent capabilities
- Considers agent personality profiles and specializations
- Optimizes for conversation diversity and quality

This component is designed to evolve toward:
- More sophisticated matching algorithms
- Dynamic agent selection during conversations
- Learning from past conversation outcomes
- Supporting user-defined selection criteria

### Conversation Context Manager

The Conversation Context Manager maintains the state and history of conversations. It:

- Stores conversation history and structure
- Manages context windows and relevance
- Handles context injection and retrieval
- Supports context visualization and analysis

This component is intended to grow into:
- Implementing more sophisticated context compression
- Supporting multi-modal context elements
- Developing context analytics and visualization
- Creating meta-contexts that span multiple conversations

### Dialogue Flow Controller

The Dialogue Flow Controller manages the flow of conversation between agents. It:

- Determines turn order and timing
- Handles interruptions and interjections
- Manages conversation branching and merging
- Supports conversation pacing and rhythm

This component is designed to evolve toward:
- More natural conversation dynamics
- Support for parallel conversation threads
- Implementation of conversation patterns and templates
- Development of flow analytics and visualization

### Conversation Memory System

The Conversation Memory System enables agents to recall and reference past conversations. It:

- Indexes conversation content for retrieval
- Manages long-term conversation memory
- Handles cross-conversation references
- Supports memory visualization and analysis

This component is intended to grow into:
- Implementing more sophisticated memory compression
- Supporting semantic memory retrieval
- Developing memory analytics and visualization
- Creating meta-memories that span multiple conversations

## Integration Points

The Agent Conversation Orchestration integrates with:

1. **[[Folder Watching Interface]]** - For receiving prompts that initiate conversations
2. **[[Agent Personality Development]]** - For accessing and updating agent personality profiles
3. **[[Idea Recording System]]** - For capturing insights generated during conversations

## Future Evolution

The Agent Conversation Orchestration is designed to evolve toward:

1. **Self-Organizing Conversations** - Conversations that dynamically adjust their structure and flow based on content and goals
2. **Multi-Modal Conversations** - Supporting not just text but also images, audio, and other media types in conversations
3. **Conversation Ecosystems** - Enabling multiple conversations to interact and influence each other
4. **Meta-Conversation Evolution** - Implementing mechanisms for conversations to reflect on and improve their own processes

## Implementation Patterns

The Agent Conversation Orchestration can be implemented using several patterns:

### Event-Driven Architecture

```python
class DialogueFlowController:
    def __init__(self, event_bus):
        self.event_bus = event_bus
        self.event_bus.subscribe("agent_response", self.handle_agent_response)
        self.event_bus.subscribe("conversation_branch", self.handle_conversation_branch)
        
    def handle_agent_response(self, event):
        # Determine next agent to respond
        next_agent = self.select_next_agent(event.conversation_id, event.agent_id)
        self.event_bus.publish("agent_turn", {
            "conversation_id": event.conversation_id,
            "agent_id": next_agent,
            "context": self.get_context(event.conversation_id)
        })
        
    def handle_conversation_branch(self, event):
        # Create a new conversation branch
        branch_id = self.create_branch(event.conversation_id, event.branch_point)
        self.event_bus.publish("branch_created", {
            "original_conversation_id": event.conversation_id,
            "branch_id": branch_id,
            "branch_point": event.branch_point
        })
```

### Graph-Based Context Management

```python
class ConversationContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contexts = {}
        
    def create_context(self, conversation_id):
        self.contexts[conversation_id] = {
            "graph": nx.DiGraph(),
            "current_node": None
        }
        
    def add_message(self, conversation_id, message):
        context = self.contexts[conversation_id]
        node_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        context["graph"].add_node(node_id, message=message)
        if context["current_node"]:
            context["graph"].add_edge(context["current_node"], node_id)
        context["current_node"] = node_id
        return node_id
        
    def get_context(self, conversation_id, node_id=None, depth=5):
        context = self.contexts[conversation_id]
        if not node_id:
            node_id = context["current_node"]
        # Get the subgraph of nodes within depth of the current node
        subgraph = nx.ego_graph(context["graph"], node_id, depth)
        return [context["graph"].nodes[n]["message"] for n in nx.topological_sort(subgraph)]
```

### Agent Selection Strategy Pattern

```python
class AgentSelectionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {}
        
    def register_strategy(self, name, strategy):
        self.strategies[name] = strategy
        
    def select_agents(self, prompt, strategy_name="default", count=2):
        if strategy_name not in self.strategies:
            strategy_name = "default"
        return self.strategies[strategy_name].select(prompt, count)
        
class DiversitySelectionStrategy:
    def __init__(self, agent_repository):
        self.agent_repository = agent_repository
        
    def select(self, prompt, count):
        # Select agents with diverse personality traits
        agents = self.agent_repository.get_all_agents()
        # Calculate diversity scores based on personality traits
        diversity_scores = self.calculate_diversity_scores(agents, prompt)
        # Return the top N agents by diversity score
        return sorted(agents, key=lambda a: diversity_scores[a.id], reverse=True)[:count]
```
