# Folder Watching Interface

The Folder Watching Interface serves as the entry point for the Prompt-Driven Ecosystem, continuously monitoring designated directories for new prompts and initiating agent conversations based on detected changes.

## Intention & Direction

The Folder Watching Interface is designed to create a seamless bridge between the file system and the agent ecosystem. Its architecture aims to:

1. **Enable Autonomous Operation** - By continuously monitoring directories for changes, the system can operate without constant human intervention, creating a more fluid and natural interaction model.

2. **Support Diverse Prompt Formats** - The interface is designed to handle various file formats and structures, allowing for rich, multi-modal prompts that can include text, metadata, references, and eventually other media types.

3. **Create Intelligent Prioritization** - Rather than simply processing files in chronological order, the system can analyze prompt content and metadata to determine optimal processing order and agent selection.

4. **Facilitate Distributed Prompt Creation** - The file-based interface allows multiple users or systems to contribute prompts simultaneously, enabling collaborative knowledge generation.

## Core Components

### Directory Monitor

The Directory Monitor component continuously watches specified directories for changes. It:

- Detects new files, modifications, and deletions
- Filters files based on configurable patterns
- Manages recursive directory monitoring
- Handles file system events efficiently

This component is designed to evolve toward:
- More sophisticated event batching and throttling
- Support for remote directory monitoring
- Integration with version control systems
- Implementation of distributed monitoring across multiple systems

### Prompt Parser

The Prompt Parser component extracts structured information from prompt files. It:

- Parses various file formats (markdown, JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Extracts metadata and content
- Validates prompt structure and requirements
- Transforms raw content into structured prompts

This component is intended to grow into:
- Supporting more complex prompt schemas
- Implementing semantic understanding of prompt content
- Developing prompt validation and enhancement
- Creating prompt analytics and visualization

### Prompt Queue

The Prompt Queue component manages the processing order of detected prompts. It:

- Prioritizes prompts based on configurable criteria
- Handles prompt dependencies and relationships
- Manages processing state and history
- Provides interfaces for queue inspection and manipulation

This component is designed to evolve toward:
- More sophisticated prioritization algorithms
- Support for parallel prompt processing
- Implementation of prompt batching and grouping
- Development of queue analytics and visualization

### Conversation Initiator

The Conversation Initiator component bridges the gap between detected prompts and agent conversations. It:

- Selects appropriate agents based on prompt content
- Initializes conversation contexts
- Manages conversation lifecycle
- Handles conversation outcomes and feedback

This component is intended to grow into:
- More sophisticated agent selection algorithms
- Support for conversation templates and patterns
- Implementation of conversation prediction and planning
- Development of conversation analytics and visualization

## Integration Points

The Folder Watching Interface integrates with:

1. **[[Agent Conversation Orchestration]]** - For managing the conversations initiated by detected prompts
2. **[[Agent Personality Development]]** - For selecting appropriate agents based on personality profiles
3. **[[Idea Recording System]]** - For recording conversation outcomes back to the file system

## Future Evolution

The Folder Watching Interface is designed to evolve toward:

1. **Bidirectional File System Interaction** - Not just reading from but also writing to the file system based on conversation outcomes
2. **Multi-Modal Prompt Processing** - Supporting not just text but also images, audio, and other media types as prompts
3. **Prompt Generation** - Automatically generating new prompts based on conversation outcomes and detected patterns
4. **Distributed Prompt Ecosystem** - Enabling multiple instances of the system to share and collaborate on prompts

## Implementation Patterns

The Folder Watching Interface can be implemented using several patterns:

### Event-Driven Architecture

```python
class DirectoryMonitor:
    def __init__(self, directories, event_handler):
        self.directories = directories
        self.event_handler = event_handler
        self.observers = []
        
    def start(self):
        for directory in self.directories:
            observer = Observer()
            observer.schedule(self.event_handler, directory, recursive=True)
            observer.start()
            self.observers.append(observer)
            
    def stop(self):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.stop()
            observer.join()
```

### Queue-Based Processing

```python
class PromptQueue:
    def __init__(self, prioritization_strategy):
        self.queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.prioritization_strategy = prioritization_strategy
        
    def add_prompt(self, prompt):
        priority = self.prioritization_strategy.calculate_priority(prompt)
        self.queue.put((priority, prompt))
        
    def get_next_prompt(self):
        if not self.queue.empty():
            return self.queue.get()[1]
        return None
```

### Plugin Architecture

```python
class PromptParser:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parsers = {}
        
    def register_parser(self, file_extension, parser):
        self.parsers[file_extension] = parser
        
    def parse_prompt(self, file_path):
        extension = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1]
        if extension in self.parsers:
            return self.parsers[extension].parse(file_path)
        raise ValueError(f"No parser registered for {extension}")
```
