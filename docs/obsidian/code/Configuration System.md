# Configuration System

The Configuration System provides the foundation for TheBookofShannon's environment and dependency management, ensuring consistent and reliable operation across different environments.

## Intention & Direction

The Configuration System is designed to create a flexible, maintainable foundation for the project. Its architecture aims to:

1. **Enable Environment Flexibility** - By separating configuration from code, the system allows for easy adaptation to different environments without code changes.

2. **Support Dependency Evolution** - The UV-based dependency management provides a modern, efficient approach to Python package management that can evolve with the project's needs.

3. **Facilitate Reproducible Environments** - The combination of pyproject.toml, uv.lock, and .envrc ensures that the project can be consistently reproduced across different machines and environments.

4. **Create Development Workflow Efficiency** - The configuration system streamlines the development workflow, reducing friction and allowing developers to focus on implementation rather than environment setup.

## Core Components

### UV Dependency Management

The project uses UV for dependency management, implemented through:

- `pyproject.toml`: Defines project metadata and dependencies
- `uv.lock`: Locks dependency versions for reproducibility

This approach is designed to evolve toward:
- More sophisticated dependency management with optional features
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- Support for development vs. production dependencies
- Creating dependency analytics for security and maintenance

### Environment Configuration

The environment configuration is managed through:

- `.env`: Stores environment variables like API keys
- `.envrc`: Configures the shell environment using direnv

This component is intended to grow into:
- Supporting different environment profiles (development, testing, production)
- Implementing secret management for sensitive values
- Providing environment validation and diagnostics
- Creating environment documentation and onboarding tools

### Project Structure

The project structure follows a modular approach:

```
TheBookofShannon/
├── .env                # Environment variables
├── .envrc              # Direnv configuration
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── pyproject.toml      # Project metadata and dependencies
├── uv.lock             # Locked dependencies
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts
│   ├── sync_docs_to_vector.py  # Vector store sync
│   └── test_assistant.py       # Assistant testing
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── lib/            # Library code
│   │   ├── pioneer/    # Assistant implementation
│   │   └── ...
│   └── thebookofshannon/  # Main package
└── docs/               # Documentation
    └── obsidian/       # Obsidian vault
        ├── code/       # Code documentation
        └── The Book of Shannon/  # Content documentation
```

This structure is designed to evolve toward:
- More sophisticated module organization as the project grows
- Integration with documentation generation tools
- Support for plugin architecture
- Creating project analytics and visualization

## Integration Points

The Configuration System integrates with:

1. **[[Pioneer Module]]** - For assistant configuration and management
2. **[[Vector Store Integration]]** - For documentation synchronization
3. **[[Crochet Thread Model]]** - For thread persistence and configuration

## Future Evolution

The Configuration System is designed to evolve toward:

1. **Configuration as Code** - Implementing programmatic configuration management
2. **Multi-Environment Support** - Supporting different environments with different configurations
3. **Configuration Validation** - Implementing validation and testing of configurations
4. **Configuration Analytics** - Providing insights into configuration usage and patterns

## Implementation Details

### pyproject.toml

The `pyproject.toml` file defines the project's metadata and dependencies:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "thebookofshannon"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Documentation and assistants for Claude Shannon's information theory"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = { text = "MIT" }
authors = [
    { name = "Jordyn Muraoka", email = "jordynfinity@gmail.com" },
]
dependencies = [
    "openai>=1.0.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "isort>=5.0.0",
]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/thebookofshannon", "src/lib"]
```

### .envrc

The `.envrc` file configures the shell environment:

```bash
# Load environment variables from .env file
source_env_if_exists .env

# Add src directory to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

# Print a message when environment is loaded
echo "TheBookofShannon environment loaded"
```

### .env

The `.env` file stores environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
