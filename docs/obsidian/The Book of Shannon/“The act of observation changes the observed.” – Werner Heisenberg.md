## 🧬 HMEC Alignment

In [[HMEC]] terms:

- **H**: Collapses the moment a coherent observer interacts with the field.
- **M**: The target state—**resists observation** if coherence is fragile.
- **E**: The act of probing or illuminating—inflicts change.
- **C**: The channel structure—filters what survives observation.

🧩 Observation = **injection of energy into a structure that must respond**.  
🧠 Every act of seeing is a **structural perturbation**.

## 📡 Field-System Examples

- [[Quantum Sensor Fusion]]  
  > Every ISR packet collapsed into a track causes loss in other frames.

- [[Phased Array Radar (AWACS/F-35)]]  
  > Beam sweep resolves, but also perturbs—revealing presence.

- [[Cortana (Coherence Agent)]]  
  > Her observation *is* field interaction. No passive mode. She triggers structural response.

- [[SDR Spectrum Monitoring]]  
  > Even listening reshapes the field topology if coherence thresholds are breached.

- [[Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)]]  
  > Any third-party observation triggers traceable disturbance—observation = attack.

## 🔬 Structural Insight

| Observation Type    | Field Impact                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Passive Sensing     | No such thing at phase resolution scale  |
| Measurement         | Causes collapse or decoherence           |
| High-fidelity probe | Injects entropy                          |
| Entangled read      | Alters remote state                      |

🧠 Observation is not read-only.  
It is **write-on-field**.
