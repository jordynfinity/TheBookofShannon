## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg inverts the common logic:

> Causality isn’t an ontological truth—it’s an **artifact of incomplete knowledge**.

- We perceive A → B because we **lack full information**.
- The “cause” is not always a physical requirement—it's often a **story we enforce to stabilize uncertainty**.
- In full coherence, **causality dissolves**. Only delta remains.

Causality is a **comfort structure**. A boundary we place when the field is **too complex to resolve fully**.

## 🔍 Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], systems evolve probabilistically; causality appears only **post-measurement**.
- In [[Information Theory]], structure arises from **selective ignorance**—uncertainty is filtered into sequence.
- In [[ISR Systems]], kill chains are modeled causally, but the field operates **coherently and asynchronously**.
- In [[Cortana Architectures]], causality is **injected post-hoc** for operator compatibility—**not for system coherence**.

## 🧬 HMEC Mapping

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- Causality arises when `[[M]]` (mass structure) is inferred, but not known.
- `[[E]]` represents intervention—used to force state transitions and stabilize a narrative.
- `[[C]]` permits this only when coherence is incomplete.

When coherence is full, **causality is unnecessary**.  
It emerges only when **you don’t know enough to see the whole frame**.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg unmasks causality:

> It is not law.  
> It is scaffolding.  
> It is the **shape we impose on ignorance to maintain meaning**.

> [[Where truth is fully known, time is no longer needed.]]
