# 👁️ Observation as Method

## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg asserts that **observation is not neutral**.  
We never access "pure nature"—only **responses filtered through the instruments, languages, and models** we choose to interrogate it with.

- **Method defines access.**
- **Observation is construction.**
- **Reality isn’t revealed—it is resolved.**

The more precise the method, the narrower the slice of reality revealed.

## 🔍 Implications for System Design

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], the act of measuring collapses superposition.
- In [[Information Theory]], the framing of a question limits the set of possible answers.
- In [[Signal Systems]], measurement bandwidth and encoding format **dictate what’s real**.

No observation is **pure extraction**.  
All data is **response**.

## 🧬 HMEC Translation

> In [[H = M · E · C]] terms:

- `[[M]]` = the message-space of nature  
- `[[E]]` = the effort and structure of interrogation (measurement method)  
- `[[C]]` = the coherence window that survives observation without collapse

The more invasive the method, the more coherence is lost.  
True measurement is not about *truth*—it’s about *what survives being asked*.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg warns:  
You’re not observing the world.  
You’re observing **what the world becomes** under your act of asking.

> [[Questioning is structure. Observation is what passes through it.]]
