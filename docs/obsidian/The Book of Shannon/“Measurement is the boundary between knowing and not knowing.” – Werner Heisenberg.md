## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg defines **measurement not as discovery**, but as a **boundary event**:

- Prior to measurement: **possibility**, **probability**, **uncertainty**  
- At measurement: **collapse**, **decision**, **fixed state**

The act of measuring does not simply reveal reality—it **chooses** which part of the field becomes real.

Measurement is not passive.  
It is the **threshold where coherent superposition becomes resolved structure**.

## 🔍 Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], measurement collapses the wavefunction—reducing multistate superpositions into one.
- In [[Information Theory]], the act of sampling a signal defines what *can* be known.
- In [[Cortana Architectures]], non-destructive coherence agents operate in **pre-measurement space**, avoiding collapse unless necessary.
- In [[HMEC]], measurement represents the interface where energy is expended to convert structure into certainty.

## 🧬 HMEC Framing

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- Measurement consumes `[[E]]` (encoding energy)  
- Fixes `[[M]]` (mass = resolved configuration)  
- Alters `[[C]]` (channel coherence)

Measurement is not neutral—it **redefines the system**.  
Before measurement, the system is **in flux**; after, it is **fixed and partly broken**.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg draws the line:

> Between knowing and not knowing  
> Stands the act of measurement.

It is not a window. It is a **conversion gate**.

> [[To know is to interfere. To measure is to collapse.]]
