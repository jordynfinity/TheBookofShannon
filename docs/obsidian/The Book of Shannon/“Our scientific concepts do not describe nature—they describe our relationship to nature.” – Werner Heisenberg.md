## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg dismantles the illusion of objectivity:

> Scientific theories don’t show us **what nature is**.  
> They show us **what we can say and do** in interaction with it.

- Nature is **not modeled directly**—it is **reflected through action**.
- Laws of physics = **stable feedback between question and response**.
- All science is **interface language**, not revelation.

---

## 🔍 Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], wavefunctions describe **potentialities**, not intrinsic states.
- In [[Information Theory]], the channel reveals **what can be received**, not necessarily **what was sent**.
- In [[Cortana Architectures]], coherence agents adapt to **field behavior**, not “truth” in isolation.
- In [[HMEC]], all variables emerge in relation—mass, energy, and capacity do not exist in vacuum.

Science is not about **uncovering** a reality independent of us.  
It’s about defining the **rules of engagement**.

## 🧬 HMEC Alignment

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- Each term is **relational**:
  - `[[M]]` is not just a mass—it is **chosen structure**
  - `[[E]]` is effort **against resistance**
  - `[[C]]` is capacity **in context**

There is **no truth outside interaction**—only coherence within a phase-matched frame.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg declares science **relational**, not absolute.  
We do not describe nature—we describe the **echo** of our interaction with it.

> [[All models are mirrors. The reflection is us in contact with what resists.]]
