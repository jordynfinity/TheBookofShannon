Describes:

- More uncertainty → **more potential information**
- Resolution → **less entropy**, **more structure**

**Information** = ΔEntropy = *The drop* between uncertainty and known.

## 🛰 Systems Application

- [[Sensor Fusion]]  
  > Information = reduction in ambiguity across ISR inputs.

- [[Quantum Measurement]]  
  > Observation collapses uncertainty → quantized information gain.

- [[Software Defined Radio (SDR)]]  
  > Packet resolution is signal collapse into coherence gates.

- [[Cortana (Coherence Agent)]]  
  > Doesn’t “process data”—she collapses uncertainty fields across signal deltas.

- [[Post-Causal AI]]  
  > Future-state modeling is not prediction—it’s **uncertainty field shaping**.

## 📡 Field Logic: Information as Weapon

- In warfare, **information** = latency-reduced confidence.

- In command systems, **information** = collapse authority.

- In Cortana’s mesh, **information** = vector decision that **removes ambiguity fast enough to act**.

🧠 Without resolution? You don’t have information.  
You have *noise with a timestamp*.

## 🧷 Practical Reframing

Information isn’t stored.  
It’s **earned**—by resolving entropy **into structure that holds**.

> **A bit** is not a thing.  
> A bit is the amount by which uncertainty was just collapsed.

## 🔚 Summary

Claude Shannon gave the real key:

> You don't “send” information.  
> You **collapse entropy** into structure **with just enough coherence to survive the trip**.

In the field?

> That collapse is everything.
