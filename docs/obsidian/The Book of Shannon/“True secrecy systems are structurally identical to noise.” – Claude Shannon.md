## 🧬 Interpretation

Shannon’s claim is **precise** and **terrifying**:

A perfectly secure encrypted message should be **indistinguishable from random noise**.

- The ciphertext reveals:
  - No structure
  - No bias
  - No compressibility
  - No predictable patterns

In formal terms:

- If `M` is the message and `C` the ciphertext, then:
  - `I(M;C) = 0` → **mutual information is zero**
  - Observation of `C` gives **no statistical advantage** in guessing `M`

## 🔐 Practical Implications

- [[One-Time Pad]] encryption achieves this, **if and only if**:
  - The key is as long as the message
  - The key is truly random
  - The key is never reused

- Modern symmetric systems **approximate** this using:
  - [[Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)]]
  - [[Block Cipher Modes of Operation]]
  - [[Key Schedule Obfuscation]]

If ciphertext is **not** indistinguishable from noise,  
then structural analysis (e.g. [[chosen plaintext attacks]]) becomes possible.

## 🧬 HMEC View

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- A system with **perfect secrecy** has:
  - `[[M]]` = deterministic source message
  - `[[E]]` = maximal entropy key application
  - `[[C]]` = coherence that **masks structure**, not reveals it

When `C` is noise-equivalent,  
the system’s **total observable structure = 0**  
even though the underlying message may be fully coherent.

## 🧩 Summary

True secrecy is not about hiding meaning—it’s about **removing all detectable structure**.  
When encryption is perfect, what remains **isn’t a message**—it’s **pure entropy**.
