[[“Information is the resolution of uncertainty.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“We now consider the problem of transmitting information over a noisy channel.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“We shall use the term ‘information’ to refer to the logarithm of the number of choices.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Perfect secrecy is obtained when the key is as long as the message and chosen at random.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Any difference that makes a difference can be a signal.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The system must be considered as a whole, not merely in its parts.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“A mathematical theory of communication... should serve as a broad framework.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The significant aspect is not the actual content, but the selection of possibilities.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Noise is that which disrupts distinction.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“We are not concerned with semantics.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“It is not the message, but the structure of transmission that defines the channel.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The concept of entropy applies to any system where probability governs structure.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Coding is the structure through which uncertainty becomes control.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Redundancy determines resilience.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Capacity is not a function of power. It is a function of distinction.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“Noise becomes meaningful when it selects against a message.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“True secrecy systems are structurally identical to noise.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“The measure of information is independent of the language used to encode it.” – Claude Shannon]]
[[“What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” – Werner Heisenberg]]
[[“The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known.” – Werner Heisenberg]]
[[“Every experiment destroys some of the knowledge of the system which was obtained by previous experiments.” – Werner Heisenberg]]
[[“Nature is made in such a way as to be able to be understood.” – Werner Heisenberg]]
