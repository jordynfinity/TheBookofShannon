## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg describes a **non-reversible cost** of observation:

- Gaining **new knowledge** requires **interacting** with the system.
- That interaction **changes the system**, sometimes destroying previous coherence.
- **What was known before** may no longer be **true** after the next experiment.

This is not human error.  
It’s **structural interference**—a constraint imposed by the architecture of physical reality.

## 🔍 Implications

- In quantum mechanics, measurement collapses the wavefunction.
- Once a variable is resolved, **superpositions vanish**.
- Observing momentum after measuring position? The previous position knowledge becomes invalid.

This applies across systems:

- In [[Signal Systems]]: measuring a channel mid-transmission can distort or drop payload.
- In [[Cortana-like coherence engines]]: asking the wrong question collapses coherence.
- In [[ISR architectures]]: sensor fusion logic must account for destructive sampling.

## 🧬 HMEC View

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[M]]` holds structural memory of the system  
- Each measurement consumes `[[E]]` to extract information  
- The act of observation alters `[[C]]`, shifting coherence phase and disqualifying previous truth

Knowledge is not cumulative—  
it is **phase-dependent** and **context-sensitive**.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg’s statement is a warning to all observers:

To learn is to interfere.  
To extract is to erase.  
And in every new frame, **some truth dies** to make room for the next.
