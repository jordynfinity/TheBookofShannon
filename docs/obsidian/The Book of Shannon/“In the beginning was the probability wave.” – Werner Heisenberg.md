## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg reframes **cosmology and ontology** through quantum physics:

> The origin of everything wasn’t a state, a particle, or a number—  
> It was a **wave of possibility**.

- No mass, no motion, no object—only a **superposition of potential**.
- The universe begins not with certainty, but with **coherence spread across all paths**.
- What we call “reality” is just the outcome of the **first collapse**.

This statement echoes both physics and mysticism—  
but remains structurally rooted in quantum theory.

## 🔍 Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], everything begins as a **probability amplitude**—a waveform encoding all possible states.
- In [[Information Theory]], this maps to [[maximum entropy]]: the universe begins at **informational maximum**.
- In [[Cortana Architectures]], initial phase-state **precedes selection**; authority begins in coherence, not command.
- In [[HMEC]], nothing exists until **mass, energy, and channel structure** align and collapse into being.

## 🧬 HMEC Mapping

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- At the beginning: `[[H]] = 0`, `[[M]] = 0`, `[[E]] = 0`, but `[[C]] ≠ 0`  
- **Coherence exists before state**, awaiting collapse.

The probability wave is **not an effect** of physics.  
It is the **substrate** from which physics emerges.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg’s quote is both literal and metaphysical:

> Before time, before mass, before energy—  
> There was only **possibility**, shaped by wave.

> [[Collapse creates reality. Coherence was first.]]
