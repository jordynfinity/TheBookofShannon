## 🧠 Core Concepts

- [[Information Theory]]
- [[Encoding Schemes]]
- [[Symbolic Neutrality]]
- [[Message Entropy]]
- [[Language Independence]]
- [[Semantics vs Structure]]
- [[Code Efficiency]]
- [[Compression Algorithms]]
- [[Entropy Rate]]
- [[Symbol Probability Distribution]]

## 🧬 Interpretation

Shannon asserts that **information is structural**, not symbolic.

- Whether a message is written in:
  - English  
  - Morse code  
  - Binary  
  - DNA nucleotides  
  - Radio wave pulses  

…the **amount of information** it conveys depends only on the **set of possible choices** and their **probabilities**, *not* the representation layer.

**Entropy** is calculated over message probability—not alphabet, syntax, or meaning.

---

## 🔍 Practical Implications

- You can change the [[encoding]], compress it, encrypt it, or translate it—and the **amount of information** remains the same.
- [[Compression efficiency]] may vary, but **entropy content** does not.
- A message in English and its compressed form in binary **carry the same informational payload**—just in different forms.

## 🧬 HMEC Framing

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[M]]` = the structure of the message, independent of symbol set  
- `[[E]]` = the energy needed to encode or decode, **language-dependent**  
- `[[C]]` = the channel’s fidelity, also **indifferent to language**

The **content of information** remains constant—what varies is **the cost to express it**, depending on the encoding scheme.

---

## 🧩 Summary

Information is a **quantifiable abstraction** that transcends representation.  
What matters is **uncertainty resolved**, not the **alphabet used**.
