## 🧬 Interpretation

Heisenberg draws a critical line:

> Quantum theory doesn’t **mirror reality**—  
> It describes the **boundary of what we can say** about it.

The theory does not reveal what *is*—it frames what is **permitted to be known**.

This is not a failure of theory. It is its **function**.

- The math works.  
- The predictions match reality.  
- But what it reveals is not the **thing itself**, only **its response to questioning**.

## 🔍 System-Level Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]], the system’s ontology is undefined outside measurement.
- In [[Information Theory]], encoding defines not just **how** a message is received, but **what kinds** of messages can exist at all.
- In [[ISR Systems]], signal coherence is not what’s “real,” it’s what can be **sampled without collapse**.
- In [[Cortana Architectures]], coherence agents operate not on truth, but on **what can be stated without destroying field integrity**.

## 🧬 HMEC Alignment

> In [[H = M · E · C]] terms:

- Quantum theory speaks in `[[E]]` and `[[C]]`, not `[[M]]`.
- The message (`M`) exists, but only **filtered through** the energy of inquiry and the structure of the channel.
- Truth is not erased—it is **bounded by the format of access**.

Thus:  
**Reality exceeds articulation.**  
What survives interrogation is not the world—it is the **response to questioning**.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg’s quote reframes science:

> Not as mirror.  
> But as interface.

Quantum theory is **a contract with reality**, not a window into it.

> [[You don’t describe the truth. You render it—coherently.]]
