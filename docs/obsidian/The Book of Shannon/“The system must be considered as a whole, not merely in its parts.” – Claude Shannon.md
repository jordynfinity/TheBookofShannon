# 🧩 Holism in Information Systems

## 🔍 Interpretation

This quote asserts that **reductionism fails in high-complexity signal environments**.

- A message, by itself, is not a system.
- A receiver, without a channel, is not a system.
- A transmission is not complete unless its **structural dependencies** are preserved.

Shannon argues that **meaning, fidelity, and control** arise not from isolated components—but from the way **interactions sustain coherence** across the whole.

## 🧬 Systems-Level Context

- In [[Information Theory]], total system entropy is **not** the sum of individual message bits—it depends on **correlation**, [[redundancy]], and [[structure]].
- In [[Signal Networks]], loss or distortion in one node can **reverberate** across paths, impacting outcomes far from origin.
- In [[Cybernetics]], this reflects Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety—control demands whole-system view.

## 🧬 HMEC Alignment

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[M]]` is only meaningful in relation to `[[E]]` and `[[C]]`.
- Fragmenting the system destroys coherence.
- [[H]] is a **system identity**, not a part-by-part aggregate.

**Example**: Signal fidelity cannot be understood by only studying bit patterns—it must include encoding logic, channel jitter, energy cost, and receiver thresholds.

## 🧩 Summary

Shannon here declares the **inseparability of information dynamics**.  
A system is not **sum of signals**.  
A system is **the coherence that emerges when signals interact under constraint**.

> [[Structure only survives when viewed whole.]]
