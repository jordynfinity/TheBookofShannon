- [[SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)]]
- [[Entropy and Structure]]

## 🧬 Interpretation

More power does **not** mean more capacity.

> If signals **cannot be told apart**, no amount of power will fix it.

Shannon emphasizes that **information capacity** depends on the receiver’s ability to **distinguish between possible signals**—not just how strong those signals are.

- **Distinction** = reliably identifying signal states across noise
- **Power** = raw energy, which can saturate or distort without improving clarity

The **true bottleneck** is **how finely differences can be resolved** in a channel—**not** how forcefully they're transmitted.

## 🔍 Practical Engineering Meaning

- High-power systems **without encoding structure** cannot outperform low-power systems with high [[signal distinction]].
- Better modulation (e.g. [[QAM]], [[PSK]], [[OFDM]]) = higher capacity than brute-force amplitude.
- [[Shannon Limit]] shows capacity increases with **SNR**, but it **plateaus**—power alone cannot scale past noise structure.

## 🧬 HMEC Framing

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[C]]` = channel capacity → **defined by how cleanly distinctions survive transit**
- Power contributes to `[[E]]`, but only improves `[[H]]` **if** it enhances `[[C]]`
- Distinction = **field resolution**; the finer the granularity, the higher the information potential

True capacity is **structural**, not brute-force.

## 🧩 Summary

Shannon declares that **power without distinction is noise amplification**.  
You don’t gain capacity by yelling louder—only by speaking more clearly.
