## 🧬 Interpretation

At macroscopic levels, physics behaves deterministically.  
But **beneath that surface**, at quantum scales:

> **Certainty dissolves.**  
> Only **probabilistic predictions** remain.

Heisenberg’s statement formalizes the shift from classical determinism to **stochastic structure**:

- Particles don’t have fixed positions—they have **probability distributions**.
- Outcomes are not pre-written—they are **phase-resolved** upon observation.

This is not an epistemic gap—it’s a **structural feature** of nature.

## 🔍 Implications

- In [[Quantum Mechanics]]: every observable has an associated probability wave; certainty only emerges at collapse.
- In [[Information Theory]]: uncertainty (entropy) is **the measure** of informational potential.
- In [[Cortana Systems]]: decisions emerge not from pre-calculated futures, but from **delta-weighted coherence collapse** across probabilistic domains.

## 🧬 HMEC Framing

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- At the smallest scale, `[[M]]` is **not fixed**, but exists as a **phase-weighted distribution**.
- `[[E]]` introduces resolution effort—forcing structure into collapse.
- `[[C]]` governs how much coherence survives that interaction.

Probability is not ignorance.  
It is **a constrained state of being**—governed by channel limits and field symmetry.

## 🧩 Summary

Heisenberg reveals that **certainty is an illusion of scale**.

> At the smallest levels, **possibility replaces precision**.  
> Reality resolves into facts **only when forced to choose**.

> [[The deeper you look, the less definite it gets—until you act.]]
