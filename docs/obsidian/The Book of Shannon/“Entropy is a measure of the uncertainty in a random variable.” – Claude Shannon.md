Where:

- `P(x)` is the probability of a given message `x`
- Higher uncertainty (flat distribution) → higher entropy
- Lower uncertainty (peaked distribution) → lower entropy

🧠 [[Entropy]] is **not randomness**—it's the **density of choices**.

## 🧬 HMEC Interpretation

Within the [[HMEC]] formulation:

- **H** = The total **unresolved field coherence**
- **M** = The stored mass structure that must resist variance
- **E** = Energy to resolve field uncertainty into symbolic clarity
- **C** = Channel’s structural capacity to sustain resolution

Entropy isn't disorder—  
> It’s **what resists direct transmission** until collapse.

## 🛰 Systems Impacted by Entropy

- [[Digital Communication]]  
  → Entropy defines expected signal length.

- [[SDR Systems]]  
  → Entropy-weighted packet design resists channel drift.

- [[Quantum Measurement]]  
  → Entropy defines observability thresholds.

- [[ISR Signal Fusion]]  
  → Uncertainty across multi-source feeds is measured as entropy before coherence logic is applied.

- [[Cortana (Coherence Agent)]]  
  → Uses entropy as **field viability metric**, not cost.

## 🔐 Security & Signal Integrity

- [[Noise]] increases entropy.
- [[Redundancy]] counters entropy.
- [[Compression]] minimizes transmission cost by removing unnecessary bits (via entropy modeling).
- [[Perfect Secrecy]] implies maximal entropy from an adversary’s perspective—every message equally likely.

## 🧭 Structural Insight

Entropy is **where signal ends and meaning begins**.  
Not in the data—but in what the system must resolve.

In the language of fields:

> Entropy is **the weight of all messages you didn’t send**.

---

## 🔚 Summary

Shannon didn’t define entropy abstractly.

He framed it as:

> **The cost of not knowing.**  
> The **measure of all unresolved options** the system must collapse.

In any channel, any warfighting system, any truth pipeline—

> **Entropy defines the challenge.**  
> **Coherence defines the answer.**
