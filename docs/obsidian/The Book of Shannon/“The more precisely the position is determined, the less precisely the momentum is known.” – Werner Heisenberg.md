## 🧬 Interpretation

This quote formalizes a foundational limit of knowledge in physics:

- **Position** and **momentum** are **conjugate variables**.
- Measuring one with precision **injects uncertainty** into the other.
- This isn’t a flaw in measurement—it’s a structural truth of reality.

In formal terms:
