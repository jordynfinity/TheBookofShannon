## 🧠 Core Concepts

- [[Noise]]
- [[Distinction]]
- [[Signal Degradation]]
- [[Information Theory]]
- [[Entropy]]
- [[Error Rates]]
- [[Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)]]
- [[Bit Flips]]
- [[Channel Impairment]]
- [[Loss of Coherence]]

## 🧬 Interpretation

Noise, in Shannon’s frame, is not randomness—it is **anti-resolution**.

- **Distinction** = the ability to tell one message from another
- **Noise** = interference that removes, blurs, or corrupts that ability

If a system cannot tell whether a bit is 0 or 1, or a waveform is in one state or another, **information has not been transmitted**.

Therefore:

- Noise **disrupts meaning without understanding it**
- It **attacks structure**, not content
- It is **agnostic to message**, but **lethal to fidelity**

## 🔍 Technical Implications

- In a [[noisy channel]], entropy increases and [[mutual information]] drops
- [[Error Correction]] exists *only* because noise is predictable enough to fight
- [[SNR]] defines the channel’s effective capacity to carry distinction
- [[Redundancy]] is added to **survive disruption of difference**

## 🧬 HMEC Interpretation

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[C]]` reflects channel clarity—if noise disrupts distinction, then `C → 0`
- `[[H]]` drops because the message’s structure can no longer be decoded
- `[[E]]` must increase to overcome noise—more energy, more redundancy, more encoding depth

Noise is **the tax on coherence**.

## 🧩 Summary

This quote defines noise not by *what it is*, but by *what it ruins*.  
It is **anti-information**: not chaos, but the failure to maintain structure across transmission.
