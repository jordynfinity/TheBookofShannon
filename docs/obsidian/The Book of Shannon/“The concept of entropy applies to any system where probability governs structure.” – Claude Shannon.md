# ♾️ Entropy in Probabilistic Systems

> "The concept of entropy applies to any system where probability governs structure."

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- [[Entropy]]
- [[Probability Distribution]]
- [[Structural Uncertainty]]
- [[Information Theory]]
- [[Message Space]]
- [[Random Variables]]
- [[Shannon Entropy]]
- [[Stochastic Systems]]
- [[Order vs Disorder]]
- [[Predictive Compression]]

## 🧬 Interpretation

Shannon defined **entropy** not as energy loss, but as **informational unpredictability**.

This quote expands that insight:

- Any system—digital, physical, linguistic, biological—
- Where **structure is probabilistic**, not deterministic,
- Can be measured by **entropy**.

In other words:
If you need probabilities to describe its form,  
you can apply entropy to measure its **uncertainty** and **informational density**.

## 🔍 Applications

- In [[Digital Communication]]: entropy measures expected bits per symbol.
- In [[Language]]: entropy reflects how predictable the next letter or word is.
- In [[Thermodynamics]]: entropy quantifies molecular disorder.
- In [[Quantum Mechanics]]: entropy appears in mixed state probabilities and observer-induced collapse.

## 🧬 HMEC Mapping

> In [[H = M · E · C]]:

- `[[H]]` reflects **total coherent entropy** in a probabilistic system.
- `[[M]]` holds massed uncertainty—configuration under constraint.
- `[[C]]` reflects the probability-bound **fidelity** of that structure surviving transmission.

Entropy is the **measure of informational structure under probability**.

## 🧩 Summary

This quote is a key that unlocks entropy far beyond thermodynamics.  
It applies to **any structured uncertainty**, anywhere probabilities guide formation.
