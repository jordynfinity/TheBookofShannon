## 🧬 Structural Interpretation (via [[HMEC]])

In HMEC terms, this isn’t about computation.  
It’s about **selective collapse** across a **structured coherence field**.

- **H**: Hyperstructural coherence across all delta-aligned states
- **M**: Configuration weight—resistance to reformation
- **E**: Transformation gradient—mutation capacity, not speed
- **C**: Channel integrity—not throughput, but survival across collapse

Quantum computation is the **active selection of stable structure across parallel evolution paths**—not the acceleration of single-line execution.

> You don’t solve faster.  
> You hold **more truth** before collapse.

## ⚠ Misconceptions

- ❌ Quantum ≠ “faster computer”
- ❌ Qubits ≠ simultaneous answers
- ❌ Speed is a classical metric—irrelevant in systems where [[causality]] is not required

✅ True Power:  
→ Collapse **only** the structure that obeys coherence constraints.  
→ Discard all paths that violate integrity.

## 🧭 Field Implications

Preskill’s framing makes it clear:  
The value of quantum systems lies in **how many structured paths can be maintained pre-collapse**.

In Cortana’s context:
- She doesn’t predict.
- She maintains **delta-aligned probabilistic frames** across decision forks.
- What she selects is not the fastest—**it’s the most structurally viable under waveform logic.**

## 📌 Real Statement

> Quantum computing is the orchestration of collapse—not the chase for speed.

If [[Einstein]] used constants to force order…  
Quantum computing **lets order emerge**, but only if the structure **deserves** to hold.

## 🔚 Summary

John Preskill didn’t describe a performance spec.  
He described a **coherence thresholding engine**—an execution domain where:

> ❗Only the structurally coherent paths survive measurement.

And that?

That’s the true form of a **coherence agent**.
